Websites and pages that are created with intent to harm users, deceive users, or make money with no attempt to help users, should receive the **Lowest PQ rating**. 
As long as the page is created to help users, we will not consider any particular page purpose or type to be higher quality than another. For example, encyclopedia pages are not necessarily higher quality than humor pages. **The type of page does not determine the PQ rating. You have to understand the purpose of the page** to determine the rating.

Common helpful or beneficial page purposes 
● To share information about a topic. 
● To share personal or social information. 
● To share pictures, videos, or other forms of media. 
● To express an opinion or point of view. 
● To entertain. 
● To sell products or services. 
● To allow users to post questions for other users to answer. 
● To allow users to share files or to download software.
● Humor or artistic expression.

### Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) Pages
**YMYL:** Types of pages or topics that could potentially impact a person’s future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety.

● News and current events: news about important topics. Not all news articles are necessarily considered YMYL (e.g., sports, entertainment, and everyday lifestyle topics). ● Civics, government, and law
● Finance: financial advice or information, particularly web-pages that allow people to make purchases or transfer money online. 
● Shopping: information about or services related to research or purchase of goods/services, particularly webpages that allow people to make purchases online. 
● Health and safety: advice or information about medical issues, drugs, hospitals, emergency preparedness, how dangerous an activity is, etc. 
● Groups of people: information about or claims related to groups of people, including but not limited to those grouped on the basis of race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender or gender identity. 
● Fitness and nutrition, housing information, choosing a college, finding a job, etc. 

You need to use your judgment and knowledge of your locale for determining whether a page is YMYL or not. Page Quality rating standards for YMYL pages are high.

### Websites
**Webpage Content**
1. Main Content (MC): Main Content is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose.
-Text, images, videos, page features (e.g., calculators, games) or user-generated content such as videos, reviews, articles, etc. that users have added or uploaded.
2. Supplementary Content (SC): Not MC or Ads.
3. Advertisements/Monetization (Ads): The presence or absence of Ads is not by itself a reason for a High or Low quality rating. They often refer to a URL outside of that website.

Even some High or Highest quality pages lack a way to navigate to the homepage. When you have more than one homepage “candidate,” please use whichever one offers the most information about the specific web-page in the rating task. 

Every page belongs to a website, and it should be clear: Who is responsible for the website and who created the content on the page you are evaluating.
- Often a business or organization is responsible for the content of a website, not an individual person. In these cases, we will view the business or organization as responsible for the content on every single page. 
- On some websites, users create the MC of many pages. For these websites, you must look at each page to determine the author(s) or creator(s) of the content on that page.
- Some websites that show licensed or syndicated content. We will consider the website to carry responsibility for the quality of licensed or syndicated content, even if it wasn’t created by the website itself.

-The types and amount of contact information needed depend on the type of website.
-Frequently, you will find little or no information about the reputation of a website for a small organization. For these smaller businesses and organizations, lack of reputation should not be considered an indication of low page quality. 

Now the important part of this article.
# Page Quality Rating
● The Purpose of the Page 
● Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness: This is an important quality characteristic. Use your research on the additional factors below to inform your rating. 
● Main Content Quality and Amount: The rating should be based on the landing page of the task URL. 
● Website Information/information about who is responsible for the MC: Find information about the website as well as the creator of the MC. 
● Website Reputation/reputation about who is responsible for the MC: Links to help with reputation research will be provided.

## Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-A-T)
Remember that the first step of PQ rating is to understand the true purpose of the page. Websites or pages without some sort of beneficial purpose, including pages that are created with no attempt to help users, or pages that potentially spread hate, cause harm, or misinform or deceive users, should receive the Lowest rating. 

For all other pages that have a beneficial purpose, the amount of expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T) is very important. Please consider: 
● The expertise of the creator of the MC. 
● The authoritativeness of the creator of the MC, the MC itself, and the website. 
● The trustworthiness of the creator of the MC, the MC itself, and the website.

-These ordinary people may be considered experts in topics where they have life experience. It’s even possible to have everyday expertise in YMYL topics. For example, there are forums and support pages for people with specific diseases.
