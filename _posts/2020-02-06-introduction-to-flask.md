## Introduction to Flask
**Flask** is a microframework. The **micro** in microframework means flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible. It doesn't mean that the web app has to fit into a single Python file. Flask doesn't make many decisions for you. Everything is mostly up to you. For example, the database you use will have to be decided by you. There are decisions that Flask does make for you. For example, there would be what templating engine to use. 

Flask supports extensions to add many functionalities to your app. Many extensions provide database integration, for validation, upload handling, and more. Flask makes your app ready for production use on a variety of needs. Once you have Flask up and running, you will find a lot of extensions available in the community to integrate your project for production. The extensions are ensured by the Flask core team. If you need more customization, you should check out the [Becoming Big](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/becomingbig/#becomingbig) chapter. 

I will be skipping the installation part and heading right to the Overview part.
